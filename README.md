# Introduction

Offshore development is pretty common these days, but well-performing offshore teams are less so. Broken and incomplete features, delivered slower than expected, with increasing tech debt and a degraded codebase, are the hallmarks of outsourced and offshore development.

Being on the receiving end of a poorly performing remote development team is distressing, especially if you've tried everything you can to fix the situation but poor-quality interactions and high levels of rework remain the norm. It’s even more upsetting if you previously had an excellent local development team you waved goodbye to.

Underperformance of remote development teams is an uncomfortable topic for the industry to talk about, particularly if you are in the business of supplying low-cost, offshore developers. Recent interest in ‘developer productivity’ by the C-suites is a good indicator of developer teams failing to deliver as management expected.

Lacking the expertise to manage a remote development team increases the chance of things going wrong, and not having deep enough pockets to withstand the difficulties can be catastrophic. Unfortunately, these experiences are only too familiar.

#### Pavan, Demetri and Res

These are the guys on the other side of the planet. They don't want to be stuck in a poorly performing remote development team. What they really want is to write good code, submit PR's multiple times per day, and be praised for being rockstar developers.

This guide contains everything you need to get them performing well together.

# Common problems

Poor communication, in some shape or form, is almost always the problem. It’s not always easy to see, so here are a few examples.

#### Poor direction

Expecting developers to magic something from a vague idea or a one-sentence user story isn’t a particularly helpful approach.

Whilst technical staff are great at solving relatively well-bounded technical problems, they are almost always dire at stepping into the customer’s shoes.

Specialist development roles have put an end to software developers actually speaking to end users. And most wouldn’t want to anyway.

#### Poor requirements

I have never come across an underperforming development team that didn’t also have a requirements problem.

Select a few requirements from your team to inspect. Are they clear and effective? Do they convey the outcome required? Follow the guidance [here](https://frankray.net/articles/clear-and-effective-user-stories/), if you need some help when doing this. Report back and tell me what you find.

Developers struggle when the people who can answer questions are not readily accessible or available. Remote developers struggle more due to their lack of co-location and increased reliance on written communication.

Difficulty hustling answers in real-time, waiting on emails and language barriers are all things a local development team would never face.

#### Lost agility

Seeing outsourced and offshore development teams the same as local teams often results in the same standardised processes being imposed on them as well.

Losing co-location, inaccessible product owners, different time zones, non-native English cultures, the predominance of junior and bootcamp coders, and command-and-control account management bring significant challenges not present in local agile development.

The effectiveness of agile working easily gets lost in the transition to remote development, along with the espoused cost benefits.

# Improving remote development

The solution is knowing what to build and communicating it effectively to the developers. Working well together counts for a lot, as well.

#### Knowing what to build

Understanding stakeholder needs is the foundation of every software product and should be a continuous and ongoing activity. But moving beyond ideas and concepts is hard work because you need to really think about what should be done. 

It's not enough to ask users, “Tell me what you want”, because they don’t always know how to answer the question. Really understanding problems and pain points is what requirements gathering is all about, a human activity that takes time and patience to do well.

Somebody needs to decide which new product features will best satisfy the stakeholders and when precisely to deliver them. Product decisions are highly visible, long-lasting and impact real users, making product ownership challenging but incredibly rewarding.

#### Communicating effectively

Developers need a clear understanding of what to do. Some developers tolerate ambiguity better than others. However, they still need a clear understanding of what to do.

User stories provide a clear understanding of what to achieve and sufficient information for the developer to make the right implementation decisions. Solutions are not prescribed, unless there is good reason to, as the developer’s job is to figure that out.

Refinement sessions ensure stories contain the necessary information for developers to work without unexpected blockers or the need for unplanned, ad-hoc conversations. Well-defined user stories are your best chance of building what is required and avoiding re-work later on.

#### Working effectively

Understand the offshore developers and accommodate their needs as best as possible, avoiding the temptation to impose local processes without first assessing their suitability.

Remote teams that work similar hours to the local business can more readily act as an extension of the local workforce. Active engagement and good communication between both sides support more intensive ways of working, such as a local Product Owner-led remote Scrum team.

Alternatively, many offshore teams perform best when they are responsible for end-to-end work rather than bouncing part-finished work back & forth between distributed teams, avoiding the need to collaborate, reducing decision latency and promoting maximum workflow.

# Summary

Offshore development is pretty common these days, but well-performing offshore teams are less so. Being on the receiving end of poorly built software is upsetting, particularly if your experiences have left you feeling powerless. But it doesn’t need to be like this.

The solution is knowing what to build and communicating it effectively to the developers doing the work. Good product ownership aims to better meet the needs of stakeholders in each software release, and well-defined user stories provide developers with the information they need to make the right decisions.

Improving remote development is easier and less costly than you may think, but it does mean changing how a company works. The development team and company management must really want to. Otherwise, inertia takes hold and everything stays the same.

If you are unhappy with your development team, they may need more detailed guidance.
